# Quickstart: ASP.NET Web API with FusionAuth

This repository contains a ASP.NET Web API that works with a locally running instance of [FusionAuth](https://fusionauth.io/), the authentication and authorization platform.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 7+](hhttps://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download): This is the main .NET framework including ASP.NET.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com): The quickest way to stand up FusionAuth.
- (Alternatively, you can [Install FusionAuth Manually](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/)).

This app has been tested with .NET 7. 

### FusionAuth Installation via Docker

The root of this project directory (next to this README) are two files [a Docker compose file](./docker-compose.yml) and an [environment variables configuration file](./.env). Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, you can stand up FusionAuth up on your machine with:

```
docker compose up -d
```

The FusionAuth configuration files also make use of a unique feature of FusionAuth, called [Kickstart](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/kickstart): when FusionAuth comes up for the first time, it will look at the [Kickstart file](./kickstart/kickstart.json) and mimic API calls to configure FusionAuth for use when it is first run.

> **NOTE**: If you ever want to reset the FusionAuth system, delete the volumes created by docker-compose by executing `docker-compose down -v`.

FusionAuth will be initially configured with these settings:

* Your client Id is: `e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e`
* Your client secret is: `super-secret-secret-that-should-be-regenerated-for-production`
* Your admin username is `admin@example.com` and your password is `password`.
* Your teller username is `teller@example.com` and your password is `password`.
* Your customer username is `customer@example.com` and your password is `password`.
* Your fusionAuthBaseUrl is `http://localhost:9011/`

You can log into the [FusionAuth admin UI](http://localhost:9011/admin) and look around if you want, but with Docker/Kickstart you don't need to.

### ASP.NET API complete-app

The `complete-app` directory contains a minimal ASP.NET API configured to authenticate with locally running FusionAuth.

Run the API with:
```
cd complete-app/
dotnet run
```

The app is now serving two api endpoints
 - [http://localhost:5001/make-change](http://localhost:5001/makeChange) - this endpoint calculates the change to make from a given total
 - [http://localhost:5001/panic](http://localhost:5001/panic) - this endpoint simulates notifying the police of an incident.

```sh
curl --location 'https://local.fusionauth.io/api/login' \
--header 'Authorization: this_really_should_be_a_long_random_alphanumeric_value_but_this_still_works' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
  "loginId": "teller@example.com",
  "password": "password",
  "applicationId": "e9fdb985-9173-4e01-9d73-ac2d60d1dc8e"
}'
```

The endpoints above will accept the token in either the `Authorization` header, or in a cookie. You can take the token from the response and then call one of the endpoints listed above by with a cookie by calling:

```sh
curl --location 'http://localhost:5001/make-change?total=5.12' \
--cookie 'app.at=<your_token>'
```

or

```sh
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:5001/panic' \
--cookie 'app.at=<your_token>'
```
To call with a bearer token in the `Authorization` header, you can call:

```sh
curl --location 'http://localhost:5001/make-change?total=5.12' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>'
```

or 

```sh
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:5001/panic' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer <your_token>'
```
